## Usage

1. Use `QR_generator.py` to generate QR code. This project was abandoned, but the OOP and connection between classes using `CustomTKinter` is done properly, so I decided to keep it.

2. Use `Text_compare_to_a_list.py` to compare a given text with given list of words.

3. `Working_with_specific_data` folder with more specific codes
