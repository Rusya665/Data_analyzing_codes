## PowerPoint Slide Generator

The `pptx_slide_generator.py` script reads in a PowerPoint template and populates it with data from a CSV file, creating a new slide for each row in the CSV.

### Usage

#### Customization

To customize the PowerPoint template and the CSV data, follow these steps:

1. Open the `template.pptx` file in PowerPoint and customize it to your needs.
2. Save the template file with a new name.
3. Create a CSV file with your data. The first row of the CSV should contain the column names that correspond to the placeholders in the PowerPoint template.
4. Save the CSV file in the same directory as the script.

#### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

python pptx_slide_generator.py -t <template_file> -d <data_file> -o <output_file>

where:

- `template_file` is the filename of your customized PowerPoint template.
- `data_file` is the filename of your CSV data file.
- `output_file` is the filename of the PowerPoint file that will be generated by the script.

## XLSX Data Plotter

The `xlsx_data_plotter.py` script reads in an XLSX file containing data and plots the data in a series of graphs. The data is grouped and plotted by the x-axis value.

### Usage

#### Customization

To customize the data that is plotted, follow these steps:

1. Open the `xlsx_data_plotter.py` file.
2. Edit the `path`, `time_line_path`, `out_path`, and `select_charts` variables to point to the correct files and folders on your system.

#### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

python xlsx_data_plotter.py
